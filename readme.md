# Letterbook's ActivityPub library

There are two primary goals with this project.

1. Type safety. This is dotnet, and we're acting like it.
2. Spec conformance. This will implement the AP spec as fully and faithfully as possible.

Once those two goals are met, we'll focus on performance optimizations and supporting major protocol extensions.

## DocFX

Documentation is generated using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) which generates API docs from .NET Source Code. In order to test out documentation locally or see the articles you have written before publishing them you will need to install the DocFX tooling and run the tool against the `LetterBook.ActivityPub.Documentation` project. New classes, functions etc will automatically be converted into API docs for you.
